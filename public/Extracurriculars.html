				<p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, my friends and I founded a free tutoring program for K-12 students to combat educational inequality in our local areas. Iridium Tutoring Ltd is now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and has provided over 10,000+ hours of free tutoring to over 300 students. At Iridium, I help organize coding for elementary students' events, webinars for college applications, algebra courses, and more!

			<div class="paragraphMargin">
				<p>Nearing the end of 2020, a group of friends and I wanted to support some of the local nonprofits in our community. At Verity Opportunities Ltd, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, I organize local volunteer events such as trail cleanups, food drives, and fundraising competitions to raise funds and awareness for local nonprofits. I enjoy meeting new people of various ages every time I volunteer at a new location, and I love how excited people are to support each other and make the world a better place.

				<p>For the past six years, I have attended an overnight summer camp called the New England Chinese Youth Summer Camp every first week of August. Last summer, I volunteered as a CIT (Counselor-In-Training), where I led overnight campers through fun cultural classes and camp activities for one week. Below are some pictures from this yearâ€™s camp!

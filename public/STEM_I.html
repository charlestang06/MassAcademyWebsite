		<h3>Abstract</h3>

		<p class="stemwords">This study aims to reduce the number of truck-cyclist
			collisions, which are often caused by semi-trailer trucks making
			right-hook turns and poor driver attention to blind spots. To achieve
			this, we designed a visual-based blind spot warning system that can
			detect cyclists for semi-trailer truck drivers. First, several 90%
			accurate object detection models, such as the EfficientDet Lite 1 and
			SSD MobileNetV2, were created using state-of-the-art lightweight deep
			learning architectures fine-tuned on a newly proposed cyclist image
			dataset composed of a diverse set of over 20,000 images, which were
			used to locate and detect cyclists actively. Next, the object
			detection model was deployed onto a Google Coral Dev Board
			mini-computer with a camera module and analyzed for speed, reaching
			inference times as low as 15 milliseconds. Lastly, the end-to-end
			blind spot detection device was tested in real-time to model traffic
			scenarios and analyzed further for performance and feasibility. We
			concluded that this portable blind spot alert device can accurately
			and quickly detect cyclists and have the potential to significantly
			improve cyclist safety. Future studies could determine the
			feasibility of the proposed device in the trucking industry and
			improvements to cyclist collisions over time.</p>

		<h3>Background</h3>

		<p class="stemwords">Cyclists often face risks when traveling
			along a road or path with other motorized vehicles; in the U.S., over
			1,000 cyclists die in road accidents, and 130,000 more are injured
			yearly (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022). Over
			71% of cyclist collisions happen in urban areas, with 30% of
			collisions happening at intersections. These cyclist accidents can be
			attributed to a lack of visual attention, including distraction,
			which is a leading cause of over 55% of vehicle-cyclist collisions
			(Jannat et al., 2020). One type of collision that frequently occurs
			between cyclists and vehicles is in a right-hook turn. Right-hook
			collisions occur at intersections when right-turning vehicles collide
			with a cyclist moving straight forwards along the right side of the
			road. These types of collisions occur when drivers do not detect
			cyclists in their oncoming blind spots or when cyclists do not
			observe that a driver is going to take a right turn. Additionally,
			semi-trailer trucks are disproportionately involved in more severe
			cyclist collisions compared to other vehicles (Richter & Sachs,
			2017). When a semi-trailer truck makes a right turn, the blind spot
			from the right rearview mirror increases as the view is blocked by
			the trailer's body. This makes turns especially dangerous because
			VRUs in this blind spot zone cannot be detected and face a high risk
			of collision and fatality (Wang et al., 2022). There exists a need
			for driver assistance systems in order to mitigate risks caused by
			vehicle blind spots and prevent truck-cyclist collisions.</p>

		<h3>Methodology</h3>

		<p class="stemwords">The overall aim of this project was to
			engineer a device that can detect cyclists in a truck’s right-rear
			blind spot and provide alerts for semi-trailer truck drivers. We set
			three major objectives. (1) Develop a system that can actively detect
			cyclists with greater than 80% mAP. (2) Create warnings for cyclists
			in a truck’s right-rear blind spot within a two-second interval. (3)
			Make it portable and installable on most semi-trailer trucks.</p>

		<p class="stemwords">First, a new proposed dataset was created by
			combining the CIMAT cyclist dataset with images available from the
			web and synthetic cyclist images in virtual urban environments from
			Parallel Domain’s Open Synthetic Dataset for Improving Cyclist
			Detection (Thomas et al., 2021). Then, the collected images were
			annotated with bounding boxes using Roboflow API and exported as a
			single-class cyclist Pascal VOC dataset with an 80-20%
			train-validation split (Dwyer & Nelson, 2022; Everingham et al.,
			2012).</p>

		<p class="stemwords">Next, we fine-tuned a cyclist detection model
			using the SSD MobileNet V2 and EfficientDet Lite model architecture
			due to their lightweight memory and CPU/TPU usage and strong
			performance with real-time detection (Sandler et al., 2018; Tan et
			al., 2020). Using the Tensorflow Object Detection API and the
			Tensorflow Lite Model Maker API, the dataset was used to fine-tune an
			SSD MobileNet and EfficientDet Lite model for a total of 50 epochs.</p>

		<p class="stemwords">Then, the trained cyclist detection models
			were deployed onto the Google Coral Dev Board with a camera module.
			The Google Coral Dev Board provides state-of-the-art performance
			concerning object detection inferences in real-time applications
			(Seshadri et al., 2022). Using the Google Coral Dev Board, the frames
			per second (FPS) of each object detection model’s inferences were
			also recorded.</p>

		<p class="stemwords">Finally, we constructed a real-time testing
			environment with a cyclist, a fixed mount for the blind spot device,
			and the blind spot device. The cyclist was guided down a straight
			path to simulate a through-going cyclist. The device was tested
			qualitatively for its effectiveness in detecting cyclists from the
			viewpoint of a truck cab and for inference speed.</p>

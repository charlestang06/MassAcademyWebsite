	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<h2>My Family</h2>
	<p>I was born in Massachusetts and lived in South Grafton for 4 years before I moved to Southborough, where I live today. I currently live with my mom, dad, and sister, who is off to Boston College this year! </p>

	<h2>Badminton</h2>
	<p> Since I was 9, I have played badminton competitively. 
	I play at the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.bostonbadminton.com" target="0"> Boston Badminton Club</a> 
	located in Westborough and have traveled to competitions across the U.S. The highest rank I achieved was #6 in my age group for Boys Doubles. Although I do not play as many competitions now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
	I still enjoy playing with friends and enjoying the sport with others. Below is a clip from a past tournaments! </p>

	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>I enjoy traveling to new places with my family. Some of my favorite vacations include places such as New York City, Alaska, Hawaii, China, Banff, and Amsterdam. However, COVID-19 has made travel much harder, and we have not been able to go to as many places as before. My familyâ€™s most recent trip was to Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick in Canada.</p>
